Veer left at the fork in CR-47 (Larimer County) and it takes you up to a parking area.  Jeep road heads north and south from parking area.  Head south, and pull off is on your right.  Site has little privacy from the jeep road / parking area.  Definitely not for RVs.  4wd recommended.  If you have a very good 4wd vehicle, you might be able to camp nearby further South (or North) off of the 4wd road.  You *might* be able to find another spot closer to the gravel.  Great for accessing Estes Park and Rocky Mountain National Park.  Off of CR 47 (Larimer County)."

    "notes": "You can camp at the trailheads(there are three) and in the over 12,000 acres of Hercules Glades.  You can only access the wilderness area itself by horse or foot, but the camping at the trailhead is fine and FREE. Two of the trailheads(at the lookout tower and coy bald) have picnic tables and fire rings, one(Blair Ridge Road) is just a place to park(3 maybe 4 vehicles)but around it there is PLENTY of room to set up and camp.  I would NOT try to get an RV to coy bald, but the lookout tower trailhead is used by horse trailers and is a short gravel road off Hwy 125.    \r\n\r\nHercules Glades Wilderness Area is 12,413 acres of the most scenic and unique country in the Midwest. Its combination of open grassland, forested knobs, steep rocky hillsides, and narrow drainages offers unusual beauty and a measure of solitude within easy reach of wilderness lovers. The area is characterized by shallow droughty soils and limestone rock outcroppings. Eastern red cedar and oak trees are interspersed with open glades supporting native tall prairie grasses. Redbud and dogwood provide beautiful spring flowers, while smoke tree and maple put on vivid fall colors. A variety of wildlife species live within the Hercules Glades including white-tailed deer, raccoons rabbits, squirrels, turkey, quail, songbirds, lizards and snakes. Copperheads and rattlesnakes may be encountered. Roadrunners, collared lizards, tarantulas, wild hogs and black bears are some of the more uncommon wildlife residents.\r\n \r\nTrails: From the trailheads there is 32 miles of maintained trails which follows along open glades, forested ridgetops and Long Creek, the primary drainage of the area. Cross country hiking in other parts of the area is allowed. Key attractions along the trail include Long Creek Falls, panoramic views of the Ozarks countryside, and a variety of native communities including open limestone glades and mixed forests.\r\nRating: More Difficult to Most Difficult with steep terrain, stream crossings, sparsely marked trail, and elevations from 600 to 1200 feet.\r\nLength: 32 miles\r\nBest Seasons: Fall, winter, and spring.\r\nLeave No Trace: Pack out what you pack in.\r\nRestrictions: Foot and Horse only.\r\n No drinking water is available at parking areas or along the trail; bring what you will need, or be prepared to sterilize water you find.\r\n\r\n HAPPY CAMPING!!!"

Look for mile marker 24 on Utah SR9 about 8 miles from Springdale, UT (entrance to Zion National Park). It does get busier on some weekends but it was great. I swam in the Virgin River and drove my Prius (very slowly) through the sand to a spot 20 feet from the river to pitch my tent. There were some rocks that I had to dodge at the entrance to the campground, and I was very careful to drive in not to soft of sand. My only complaint was the millions of ants in the sand."

Campground is bounded on the North by the East Fork of the Gila River. Two side-by-side pit toilets but no other amenities. Sites most often have a fire ring made of rocks by previous users. Steep entry road but good large landing for larger vehicles to turn right into campground at the bottom. If your RV is over 35', you probably shouldn't drive NM Hwy 15 in the first place, otherwise you should be confortable with mountainous grades and curves. GPS is for site at the east end of campground. Topozone map is very accurate and helpful. Avoid summer holiday weekends, too crowded. Gila Cliff Dwellings are a minature Mesa Verde that can be toured in two hours or less. Monument is 100 years old in 2007 so lots of history available. Gila Hot Springs is also a tourist destination between Grapevine CG and the Monument along Hwy 15. Convenience store and phone there. NO cell phone service."

This area is comprised almost entirely of the San Juan NF (south of Ophir) or Uncompagre National forest to the north. "

As you enter the East Stronghold Canyon, you pass in the shadow of rocks that quite likely served the Apache warrior as perches for his lookouts. The haunting shapes into which the forces of nature have carved those rocks helps make a visit to this charismatic place an unforgettable experience.Campsites at Cochise Stronghold are shaded by oaks and surrounded by a diverse community of vegetation that includes plants of both the Upper Sonoran and Chihuahuan Desert. To help you become better acquainted with this unusual environment, the Stronghold Nature Trail follows a 0.4 mile barrier-free loop that wanders among the yucca, cactus and rocks. This short, easy stroll provides a self-guided introduction to a number of desert plants as well as some of the principles of desert ecology. It also provides good views of the rocks that form the ramparts of the Stronghold. A barrier-free history trail in the campground tells of the area\u2019s colorful past. If you would like to retrace the steps of this area\u2019s historic residents even deeper into their nearly impenetrable refuge, you may choose to follow the Cochise Trail past dozens of fantastic rock formations as it makes its way across the Dragoons to West Stronghold Canyon and the Council Rocks historic area.

The Spring River is one of Arkansas`s more accessible streams, with RT 63 paralleling much of its length. Major public access points include Cold Springs and Dam #3 off RT 63 between Hardy and Mammoth Spring, Bayou Access off RT 289, Hardy Beach, the Wilford Launch Area off RT 58, two put-in/take-out points at Ravenden, and a final launch site at Imboden.
